# PillLogger

Android app proect in our 1. year of studying at Metropolia University of Technology

The app is used to keep track of medication taken during a treatment.

The app works by having QR codes for each day and you scan the QR code after taking the medication. Then the app saves the time when the medication was taken to your phones local storage where you can view previous times you have taken a pill.
